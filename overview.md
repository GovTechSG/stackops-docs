# About StackOps

StackOps is part of the monitoring component of the Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS). It was conceptualised to enable agencies to embrace Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), which emphasises observing the performance of every component and service in a system.

The SRE approach will also improve DevSecOps maturity by shifting logging and monitoring into the development cycle. As a  result, it ensures that operational concerns and reliability concepts are built-in.

As a component, StackOps helps its users to :

- Track and monitor traces
- Track and monitor logs and metrics
- Monitor application performance and
- Provide operational transparency for effective incident response.


## What is StackOps?

StackOps is a monitoring tool that focuses on the most important and critical user actions of a user’s service. Alerts can be configured to trigger notifications whenever the application's performance breaches the threshold.

It features automated reactions based on the golden monitoring and logging metrics such as latency, load, limit, and errors. With StackOps, a user can access [Elastic Cloud deployment](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-create-deployment.html), a managed service that enables metrics monitoring and application observability using logs and traces.

StackOps features are:

- Application Performance Monitoring
- Cross-cluster replication
- Autoscaling
- Monitoring
- Network Security

## Benefits of StackOps

Adopting StackOps can benefit users in the following ways:

- Users can configure and start monitoring and logging their systems and metrics as required.
- It creates meaningful presentations of metrics that are aggregated based on what service owners, administrators, and customers need to know.
- It fills the need for monitoring and logging solutions that are quick and easy to set up, which is currently not readily available.
- It resolves issues with tracking System Level Objectives (SLOs) for Whole-of-Government (WOG) products and services.
- It offers a one-stop solution for monitoring the health  and performance of government services.

## Success stories

StackOps’ customer base grew from two to fifteen within five months. It is now used in SGTS products and the [Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/infrastructure-and-hosting/government-on-commercial-cloud) platform.
